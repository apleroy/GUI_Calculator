GUI_Calculator
==============

Basic GUI Calculator built in Java that uses the Swing framework

The purpose of this application was to build a basic GUI calculator to gain exposure to the Java GUI interfaces
and the ways in which action listeners and events relate.


3 Updates to make shortly:
1.  Have "0" displayed in the JText field upon application open
2.  Potentially format/round doubles to last unique digit
3.  Add to the UI and deploy as JAR
